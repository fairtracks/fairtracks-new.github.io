This is the source code of the **[FAIRtracks.net](https://fairtracks.net)** web site.

The website is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) using the [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) and the
[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) UI library, all in version 2. The code is originally based on
the [ModeVue](https://github.com/staticdesigner/modevue) template (available under the MIT license),
which has been heavily extended, both visually and in terms of functionality.

## Build Setup

You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with access to the command-line and permission to
install new system packages. An active internet connection is required in order to install the
following required software:

- Node https://nodejs.org/en/ (v16, v17, or v18)
- NPM https://www.npmjs.com/

Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped theme and run the `npm install`
command. This will install all of the required packages and prepare your project for local
development and production deployment. Once complete, type `npm run dev` and press the
<kbd>enter</kbd> key. Vue CLI will then compile the project and serve a local server located at
http://localhost:5050.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:5050
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server at localhost:3000
$ npm run static
$ npm run static:quick  # drop image optimizations, for speed

```
