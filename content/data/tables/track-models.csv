[Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)](https://www.insdc.org) 	Long-standing foundational initiative that operates between NCBI, EMBL-EBI and DDBJ to facilitate genomic data exchange. 	XML 	 Modern implementations of this model are the [ENA metadata model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html) and the [Sequence Read Archive (SRA) schemas](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=xml_schemas). 	NCBI, EMBL-EBI and DDBJ	
[International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC)](https://icgc.org/) 	Organization aiming at coordinating the production of reference maps of human epigenomes. 	 XML 	 Extended from SRA described at [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-metadata/blob/master/specs/Ihec_metadata_specification.md).	[BLUEPRINT](http://blueprint-data.bsc.es/) and [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/)	[IHEC data portal](https://epigenomesportal.ca/ihec/)
[Functional annotation of animal genomes (FAANG)](https://www.animalgenome.org/community/FAANG/)	Consortium to discover basic functional knowledge of genome function to decipher the genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) link in farmed animals. 	Inherited from hosting plateform (BioSamples, EBI, ENA SRA, NCBI, ArrayExpress or ENA) 	The [FAANG metadata model](https://github.com/FAANG/dcc-metadata/blob/master/docs/faang_metadata_overview.md) supports the [MIAME](https://www.fged.org/projects/miame/)and [MINSEQE](https://www.fged.org/projects/minseqe/) guidelines. 	[FAANG data portal](https://data.faang.org/home) 	Use ontology [Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/) and the ontologies it imports.
[International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)](https://icgc.org/) 	 Coordinates research groups that aims to generate and publicly release comprehensive catalogues of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic information across 50 different cancer types/subtypes.	[Data Dictionary](https://docs.icgc.org/dictionary/viewer/).   	Raw sequences are collected from [European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/). In consequence metadate must follow the [EGA metadata model](https://docs.icgc.org/submission/guide/overview/submitting-raw-data-ega/#fragment-of-the-sample-xml-file). 	[ICGC data portal](https://dcc.icgc.org) 	 ICGC also established the [Pan Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG)](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg), a federated database where patients medatadata is mapped and normalized to  data folowing models.
[Genomic Data Commons (GDC)](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc)	 Aims to provide a data repository enabling the sharing of data across cancer genomic studies in support of precision medicine. 	[GDC data model](https://gdc.cancer.gov/developers/gdc-data-model), represented as a graph with nodes and edges, maintains the critical relationship between projects, cases, clinical data, and molecular data. 	Track model inherited from SRA model. 	[The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga), [Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target), and other programs.	
[Investigation Study Assay (ISA)](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html#) 	 Propose a metadata framework provides a flexible solution for rich description and annotation of experimental outputs for the most common scientific domains	Tabular, JSON and Resource Description Framework (RDF) 	Files formats are handled by [ISA tools](https://isa-tools.org/), handling creation, validation, and conversion of ISA objects.	  		ISA framework is recognized by ELIXIR Europe as a [Recommended Interoperability Resources](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/interoperability/rir-selection#:~:text=An%20ELIXIR%20Recommended%20Interoperability%20Resource,thus%20supporting%20the%20FAIR%20Principles).
