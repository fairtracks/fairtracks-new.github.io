FAIRtracks regroup practical tools and data models essential to developing software and databases to
handle FAIR compliant data and metadata. The website introduces challenges specific to biological
research and genomic tracks. FAIRtracksâ€™ file and metadata standards are designed to be used by core
and connected services presented here. Most core tools are developed to ensure data and metadata
compliance with the FAIRtracks model and convert existing ones used by connected services. All
presented tools are open sources, and their code is available through GitHub.
