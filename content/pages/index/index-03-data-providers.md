FAIRtracks propose a clear and useful data model aimed at capturing the essential information that
would ensure FAIRification of the (meta)data. The required attributes are necessary for generic
discoverability and re-analysis, and include resolvable references to relevant metadata records from
external sources. The scope of the FAIRtracks standard is to augment existing data models with
machine-actionable content, not to replace them entirely: FAIRtracks allows for additional metadata
fields to be added by the providers. We have the ambition to interact with core data providers and
tools developers to compile a catalogue of additional content.
