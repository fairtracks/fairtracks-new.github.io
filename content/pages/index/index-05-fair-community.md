The FAIRtracks data model and the associated ecosystem are designed with the FAIR principles in
mind. An improved findability over existing standards is ensured by requiring a FAIRtracks document
to be published with a document identifier (DOI). Our recommended platform for data publishing is
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), as this service supports DOI versioning and offers the option to
reserve a DOI prior to publication. In our vision, this implementation will set the basis for a
globally accessible service to register identifiers to single track files or collections.
