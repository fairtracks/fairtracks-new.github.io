FAIRtracks goal is to propose new solutions to the growing challenge of sharing and reusing the
rapidly expanding biological data produced by the research community. The FAIRtracks ecosystem
regroups a suite of practical tools and data models easily deployable to an already existing
pipeline to ensure data and metadata compliance with FAIR principles. The community regrouped
material, including multiple publications and presentations aimed at end-users to better defined and
understand FAIRtacks strategy and services.
