Track collections are structures that group one or more types of resources such as databases, standards or policies.
They can represent a domain, a project or an organization. Deposition of data relies on multiple standards for 
tracks deposit; consequently, available data and metadata may differ from collection to collection. 

Many efforts have been made to uniformize these standards to follow the FAIR data principles. For example, the 
Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) standard has been adopted by the most popular track 
collections such as [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) or [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GEO). Another example is regarding Novel DNA sequence, novel RNA sequence, and novel genome 
assembly data that must be deposited to repositories that are part of the International Nucleotide Sequence 
Collaboration (INSDC) following a standard feature table. Consequently, tracks can be featured on multiple 
collections with or without a cross identifier.

Projects exist to help find a relevant collection to one's interest such as [Repository Finder]
(https://repositoryfinder.datacite.org) and [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org). Moreover, Track hubs are 
created by researchers or projects to easily visualize genomic tracks in popular genome browsers such as [UCSC] or 
Ensembl and can be found on [UCSC Track hub list](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect? redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu) 
or [Track Hub registtry](https://www.trackhubregistry.org).
