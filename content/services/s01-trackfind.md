TrackFind is a categorical search engine for genome track metadata. It provides:

- Hierarchical browser of the metadata model and all possible values
- Graphical builder of SQL-based search queries 
- Browse results in table or hierarchical form
- Export of results in JSON or GSuite formats
- REST API

The REST API allows downstream tools and scripts to easily integrate TrackFind search, as demonstrated by the 
GSuite HyperBrowser and EPICO.
