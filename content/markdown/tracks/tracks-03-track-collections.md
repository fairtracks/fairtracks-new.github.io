Track collections are structures that group one or more types of resources such as databases,
standards or policies. They can represent a domain, a project or an organization. Deposition of data
relies on multiple standards for tracks deposit; consequently, available data and metadata may
differ from collection to collection.

Many efforts have been made to uniformize these standards to follow the FAIR data principles. For
example, the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) standard has been adopted by
the most popular track collections such as [ArrayExpress](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) or
[Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (GEO). Another example is regarding
Novel DNA sequence, novel RNA sequence, and novel genome assembly data that must be deposited to
repositories that are part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Collaboration (INSDC) following
a standard feature table. Consequently, tracks can be featured on multiple collections with or
without a cross identifier.

Projects exist to help find a relevant collection to one's interest such as
[Repository Finder](https://repositoryfinder.datacite.org) and
[FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org). Moreover, Track hubs are created by researchers or
projects to easily visualize genomic tracks in popular genome browsers such as [UCSC] or Ensembl and
can be found on
[UCSC Track hub list](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect?redirect=manual&source=genome.ucsc.edu)
or [Track Hub Registry](https://www.trackhubregistry.org).
