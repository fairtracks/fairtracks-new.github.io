In the spirit of Open Science, the [FAIRtracks](/standards/#standards-01-fairtracks) ecosystem
provides [technical solutions](/services/) for the [abundance](/tracks/#tracks-03-track-collections)
of [genome browser](/tracks/#tracks-02-genome-browsers) track files
(["genomic tracks"](/tracks/#tracks-01-genomic-tracks)) to become "Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable ([FAIR](/fair/#fair-01-fair-data-fairtracks))" in new research contexts.
