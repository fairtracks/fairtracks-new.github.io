July 2023: We are taking the next step to launch a new initiative – a working group in the Research
Data Alliance (RDA) where everyone is invited!

Building on previous achievements, we want to expand with new data providers, tool developers, and
user communities. Together, we want to build a new global standard from the bottom up!
