We aim to connect:

- data producers
- biocurators
- tool developers
- the FAIR community
- researchers/data analysts
- ...and other interested parties

Together we can mobilize the power of genomic track data and metadata at the fingertips of the
researchers / bioinformaticians that are the target end users.
