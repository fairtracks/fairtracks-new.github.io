Working in concert with the [FAIRtracks draft standard](/standards/#standards-01-fairtracks) for
metadata of genomic tracks, we have built an [ecosystem of services](/services/) to interface with
track metadata, including:

- [Metadata augmentation](/fair/#fair-05-augmentation)
- [Metadata validation](/fair/#fair-06-validation)
- [Metadata transformation](/fair/#fair-07-transformation)
- [Precision search](/tracks/#tracks-04-finding-tracks)

You can connect to these core services both upstream (for data providers/biocurators) and downstream
(for tool developers/analytical end users).
