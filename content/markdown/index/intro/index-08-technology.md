title: Quality metadata and services

Working in concert with the [FAIRtracks draft standard](/standards/#standards-01-fairtracks) for
metadata of genomic tracks, we have built an ecosystem of services to interface with track metadata:

- [Metadata augmentation](/services/#services-05-augmentation)
- [Metadata validation](/services/#services-06-validator)
- [Precision search](services/#services-04-trackfind)
- [...and more](/services/)

You can connect to these core services both upstream (for data providers/biocurators) and downstream
(for tool developers/analytical end users).
