The FAIRtracks ecosystems proposes a novel framework for working on harmonized collections of
genomic track datasets from multiple sources. This is enabled by the FAIRtracks metadata exchange
standard, implemented in a number of services and allowing for precision search of collection of
genomic tracks via TrackFind and consequent acquisition, processing, and analysis on portals such as
the Genomic Hyperbrowser or Blueprint/EPICO.
