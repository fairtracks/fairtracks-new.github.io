      Overview of the key objects in the [FAIRtracks metadata
      standard](/standards/#standards-01-fairtracks). A "track" is an atomic element representing a
      genomic track data file. Each "track" is generated by an "experiment", physically or _in
      silico_. Physical "experiments" link out to "samples". Sets of "experiments" are contained
      within a "study" object. Finally, "tracks" are grouped into "track collections", which
      directly matches the existing track hub object. A "track collection" can also refer to an _ad
      hoc_ collection of tracks, e.g., documenting  the input data of published analyses. [From

**INSDC.** Many of the metadata models for annotation of genomic datasets available today evolved
from [INSDSeq](https://www.insdc.org/documents/xml-status), INSDSeq is the official supported XML
format of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC), a long-standing
foundational initiative that operates between NCBI (in the USA), EMBL-EBI (in the UK) and DDBJ (in
Japan) to facilitate genomic data exchange. The INSDSeq standard proposes the assignment of a number
of interlinked metadata objects to each data file, the most relevant among these being “Experiment”,
“Study”, and “Sample”. Modern implementations of this model are the
[European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) metadata model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html)
and the
[Sequence Read Archive (SRA) schemas](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=xml_schemas)
(see _Figure 2.1_).

**ISA.** The
[Investigation Study Assay (ISA)](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html#)
metadata framework provides a flexible solution for rich description and annotation of experimental
outputs for the most common scientific domains. The ISA abstract model exhibits a hierarchical
nested structure comprising the "Investigation", "Study", and "Assay" metadata categories. The ISA
model is implemented in tabular, JSON and Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats and it is
supported by dedicated software, [ISA tools](https://isa-tools.org/).

_Table 2.1_ lists these and other well-developed data models in use for genomic track data.

**Objects.** Developed in relation to these data models and others, the FAIRtracks data model is
based on five key objects: "Track collection" "Study", "Sample", "Experiment", and "Track". The
relationships between the objects are illustrated and explained in _Figure 2.2_, while the mapping
of the FAIRtracks objects to other data models are shown in _Table 2.2_.

**Metadata fields.** The additional attributes for each object type in FAIRtracks have been defined
by striking a compromise between the work imposed on the producer and the consumer of the metadata.
As a result, the mandatory attributes are only the ones that appeared necessary for generic
re-analysis of the data. Notably, these fields also include resolvable references to relevant
existing metadata records in external resources, in compliance with the
[FAIR data principles](/fair/#fair-01-fair-data-fairtracks) (see above).
