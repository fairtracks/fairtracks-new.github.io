_Genomic track files_ were originally designed and optimized to be displayed within _genome
browsers_. A genome browser is a type of genome-wide visualization software able to display various
datasets as parallel tracks along the DNA sequence coordinates of typically reference genomes. A
multitude of genome browsers are available as online web services on top of a database of track
files and/or as installable software. A selection genome browsers are listed below:

The term "track" implies a mental visual model of elements located along some line. In the domain of
genomics this typically relates to a coordinate system defined by a reference genome sequence
collection. This is a crucial model to keep in mind also for non-visual analysis scenarios. There
exists, to our knowledge, no other term in broad use which is both general and precise enough to
cover the same heterogeneity of data content, data representation and analysis scenarios as the term
"track" (or a variation thereof). Hence, the FAIRtracks team advocate the use of the term "track"
also in analysis scenarios outside the realm of genome visualization.
