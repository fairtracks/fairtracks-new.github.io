Ontologies are a formal way of representing knowledge in which concepts are described by their
meaning and their relationship. Ontologies assign to each concept (or term) its own unique
identifier (ID), thus facilitating archiving, storing and accessing data in databases.

For example, a phagocyte is a cell type represented by a term (or concept) with a description, an ID
and relationships. Its relationship defined it as a subclass of Native cell, Motile cell, stuff
Accumulating cell, and defensive cell; other terms with their own definition, ID and relationships
(see diagram). A Cell Ontology allows the definition of all of those concepts.

Interoperability across ontologies is invaluable to describe complex biological knowledge with
composite annotations. Ontologies attribution of unique IDs to biological terms not only facilitates
storing and searching data in databases but also linking information between them. Using the
previous example, the phagocyte cell type as a unique ID in
[Cell Ontology](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/cl.html), but also foreign ID linking it to the
[Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org) describing phagocytosis as a biological process linked to
the cell.

To support interoperability, [OBO foundry](https://obofoundry.org) is a community whose goal is to
provide a set of interoperable ontologies that are both logically well-formed and scientifically
accurate. They review participating ontologies according to sets of
[principles and frameworks](https://obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html).
[BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org) proposes a service to access OBO foundry's complying
ontologies.
